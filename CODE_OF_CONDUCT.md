# Mica For Everyone Code of Conduct

## Preamble
In establishing a productive community to develop Mica For Everyone, we, the maintainers of Mica For Everyone, 
have put forth this Code of Conduct to ensure that communications that happen within the community remain constructive,
and that everyone feel that they are respected for their contributions.

## Standards
The standards enforced as part of this Code of Conduct includes:
- **Do no harm:** Do not harass, attack or otherwise antagonize anyone.
- **Be respectful:** be open-minded towards others and their opinions, even if you disagree with them.
- **Stay on topic:** Making off-topic posts or spam devoids time necessary to develop the project.

## Enforcement
### Reporting
Should you have any concerns about the behavior of others, or any questions regarding this Code of Conduct,
you are free to private contact the maintainers through one of the channels below of your choosing:

#### Email
- really-dongle@outlook.com

### Strategy
Depending on the severity of the issue, we may choose to exercise the following methods to keep the community safe
and true to its goals:

#### Editing
We may choose to edit a member's message if it's found to be poorly worded.

#### Warning/Deletion
If your message is deemed inappropriate, we may choose to issue a warning and/or hide the message in question.

#### Mute
In case you are found to have repeatedly violated rules, we may issue a temporary or permanent mute against you.

#### Ban
For serious infractions or excessive repetition of rule-breaking behavior, a ban may be enforced.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces that is under the Mica For Everyone name, including but not limited to
all issues and pull requests made on all repositories under the MicaForEveryone GitHub account.

This Code of Conduct generally does not apply to behaviors of members (including contributors and maintainers)
outside the Mica For Everyone name. In fact, we encourage that members take sensitive issues outside of our community spaces.
However, in exceptional cases where a member is particularly hostile towards others outside community spaces,
maintainers may, at their discretion, override this and enforce moderation actions as needed.
